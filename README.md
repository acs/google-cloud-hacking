# Google Cloud Platform Hacking

Hacking with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

All the samples will be executed in GCP with a personal account 
trying to avoid always having costs.

The language used will be Python if possible but you can translate
the samples to other supported languages like Java following
CGP services doc.
