# Google PubSub

To use this sample you need to create a service account with PubSub editor role, generate a private key for it, save it to a file
and configure this env variable:

```
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<file_path_with_private_key>
```

You need to install also the [google-cloud-pubsub python library](https://googleapis.dev/python/pubsub/latest/index.html).
